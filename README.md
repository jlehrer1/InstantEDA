# Instant EDA
Instantly generate exploratory data plots

Ideas so far:

Number of NaN's in each column  

Percent of Nan's in each column. 

Correlation matrix. 

distribution matrix for all features?  

univariate distribution of each feature (bar + kde for numeric,  just bar for categorical)

time series distribution of numeric features if we can infer a timestamp column (look at: [this](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.infer_objects.html))

pairplot of all  numerical everything if number of columns is manageable
